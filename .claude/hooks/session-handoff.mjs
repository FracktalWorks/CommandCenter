/**
 * SessionStart — inject `project-docs/HANDOFF.md`'s open entries into context.
 *
 * D39. The problem this solves: work that spans sessions was carried in the
 * owner's head. A session ended with three owner-gated items and two scoped-out
 * findings, and the next one started blind — so the items were re-derived, or
 * more often not.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY A HOOK AND NOT A LINE IN CLAUDE.md. CLAUDE.md is the ROUTER: it is
 * edited when the architecture changes, which is rarely, and every session
 * reads it the same way. A pending-work queue changes every session. Putting a
 * mutable queue inside a stable document means the stable document stops being
 * trusted as stable — and, worse, a stale queue entry there is indistinguishable
 * from doctrine. Separate file, separate lifetime, separate trust level.
 *
 * This hook deliberately does NOT run each entry's Check. Executing commands
 * out of a markdown file at session start would be an arbitrary-execution seam
 * pointed straight at the one file every session loads, and a slow or hanging
 * check would block startup. The session runs the Checks itself, under the
 * permission model, having read them.
 *
 * Fails OPEN and silent: a missing or malformed HANDOFF.md must never stop a
 * session from starting. The worst case is the status quo ante.
