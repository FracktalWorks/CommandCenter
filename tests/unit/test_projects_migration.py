"""The projects migration, read as text — idempotency and the shape §3 specifies.

Spec: ``project-docs/specs/project_management_app.md`` §3 · WS-27a done-when 1.

**Why static.** ``infra/postgres/README.md`` requires every ``02+`` migration to
be idempotent, because ``apply_migrations.sh`` replays the whole ladder on every
deploy. The obvious way to check that is to run it twice — and §10 deliberately
runs no database, so an idempotency claim that holds only "by inspection" is not
a claim at all. Reading the file is what makes it enforceable in CI: a
``CREATE TABLE`` that loses its ``IF NOT EXISTS`` fails here rather than on the
second deploy, which is the deploy nobody watches.

The file is found by CONTENT, not by number: R1 forbids writing an absolute
future migration number anywhere, and a test pinned to ``145_`` would be the
same mistake in a different file. If the migration is renumbered in review, this
still finds it.

# ── 167: repainting the seeded status colours nobody chose ───────────────────
#
# `pm_task_statuses.color` was stored from migration 146 and rendered nowhere
# until WS-27ad, so these values were never seen by a human and never chosen by
# one. When the column finally rendered, a stored colour was made to OUTRANK the
# one derived from the category — that is what lets an owner choose — which
# means a seed disagreeing with the shared vocabulary silently overrides it on
# every project nobody customised. 167 repaints exactly those rows.
#
# The two properties worth fencing are the ones that would hurt if they broke:
# it must not touch a row a human has edited, and its target colours must equal
# what the shared vocabulary derives.
