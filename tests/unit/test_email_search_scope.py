"""Unit tests for the search bar's query surface (`/email/search`).

Covers what the Outlook-style search bar composes onto a query: a folder SCOPE
(a real folder, `all`, or `starred`), closable tag pills, and from:/to: pills —
plus the filters-only case, where pills narrow the mail with no search text.

The DB session is mocked, so the generated SQL and its bound params are
