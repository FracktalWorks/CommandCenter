"""WS-27o — recurring tasks.

Spec: `ai-company-brain/specs/project_management_app.md` §11.2 item 7, §11.13.

Recurrence looks trivial and is not. Each of these is a different way to be
quietly wrong for a year:

* **January 31st, monthly.** Clamping to February and *storing* the clamped day
  permanently demotes the rule to the 28th. It has to clamp at computation time.
* **February 29th, yearly.** Same shape, once every four years.
* **A weekly rule crossing Sunday.** "Mon and Thu, every 2 weeks" must land on
  both days of the right weeks, not alternate between them.
* **A task closed six weeks late.** An anchor of `due` that does not catch up
  produces a successor already overdue the moment it appears, which teaches
  people the date means nothing.
* **A task closed twice.** Reopening and re-closing must not spawn a second
  successor.

Pure functions, tested directly. No Postgres, no fake.
