"""Read an image's format and dimensions from its header. Nothing else.

Used by the organisation-branding routes to decide whether an uploaded logo is
acceptable before it is stored and served back to every member of the org.

WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A CALL TO PILLOW
--------------------------------------------
An uploaded logo is attacker-controlled bytes from any admin of any tenant, and
it ends up rendered in every colleague's browser. The question we need answered
is narrow — *is this a PNG/JPEG/WebP, and how big is the canvas* — and the
narrowest possible reader is the correct tool for it:

* **It never decodes pixels.** Image decoders are where image CVEs live: a
  malicious PNG is dangerous because something inflates it. This module reads
  fixed offsets and length-prefixed chunk headers and stops. There is no
  decompression, no allocation proportional to the declared dimensions, and no
  code path that touches the payload after the header.
* **It has no dependencies.** Pillow is not currently in the tree, and pulling a
  C-extension image library into the gateway to read four integers would be the
  larger security decision of the two.

The trade is honest and worth stating: we verify the header, not the whole file.
A file whose header says PNG and whose body is corrupt passes here and renders
as a broken image in the browser. That is a cosmetic failure the uploader sees
immediately, and it is a much better failure mode than running a full decoder
over hostile input on the server.

**The format sniff is done on the BYTES, never on the declared content type.**
A browser's `File.type` comes from the client and an API caller can send
anything at all; `image/png` on a file that is really an SVG is exactly how a
script gets into a page that believed it was serving a raster. The MIME type
this module returns is derived from the magic bytes and is the only one that is
allowed downstream.
