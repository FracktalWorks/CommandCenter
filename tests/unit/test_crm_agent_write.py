"""The CRM assistant's four write tools (WS-26d-write).

Spec: ``project-docs/specs/crm_app.md`` §9 ``### WS-26d-write``. The
whole-surface properties — registration, the verb allowlist, the path fence,
risk annotations across all eight tools — live in ``test_crm_agent.py``; what is
asserted HERE is what each write tool *does*.

The property this file exists for is one sentence: **nothing is written until a
human says so, and when there is no human, nothing is written.**

Three things follow from that, and each is tested separately because each fails
separately:

1. **Denied ⇒ no mutation.** The shape at
   ``test_email_tool_consolidation.py::test_digest_send_is_gated_and_fails_closed``.
   ⚠️ The invariant is *no mutation before consent*, not *no traffic before
   consent* — and the difference is deliberate. ``update_deal_status`` has to
   resolve "Negotiation" to a status id, and ``convert_lead`` has to know
   whether this lead has already been converted, BEFORE either can put an
   honest sentence on the confirmation card. A card that reads "move deal
   8f3c-… to <a stage nobody checked exists>" is not consent; it is a
   signature bought under a misdescription. So both may GET first, and the
   assertion is that the recorded calls contain no POST/PATCH — while
   ``create_lead`` and ``log_activity``, which need no pre-read, are held to
   literally zero calls.
2. **No channel ⇒ denied.** Asserted against the REAL
   ``request_confirmation``, not a stub returning False: the fail-closed
   behaviour is a property of that function's last line, and a test that stubs
   it proves only that the stub works. This is the one that catches
   ``non_interactive_default="approve"`` creeping in.
3. **Approved ⇒ exactly the intended request.** Endpoint and body both. A tool
   that confirms and then posts the wrong payload has passed the gate and
   failed the job.

Plus the two arguments that are NOT on the surface, because leaving them off is
the control: no ``owner_email`` anywhere (the route derives it from the acting
user), and no status/lost-reason UUID — those are given by name and resolved
here against the CRM's own vocabulary, which the tool reads and never writes.

Hermetic: no gateway, no DB, no network, no MAF runtime.
