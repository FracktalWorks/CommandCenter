"""Projects · the grant read model — who can see what, and what they get told.

Spec: ``ai-company-brain/specs/project_management_app.md`` §3.2, §4, §8 D-PM-3 ·
ticket WS-27a done-when 4.

This is the security fence for the whole app. Unlike the CRM — where D-CRM-3
deliberately made records org-visible to feature holders — a project is visible
only when a grant on it *or an ancestor* matches the caller, because Center
slices are the entire point of this feature.

Every scoping case is exercised as **a colleague holding only
``feature:projects``**, never as the owner: the owner holds ``*`` and therefore
``data:org:read``, so an owner-only suite would pass against a completely
unscoped route.

Hermetic: no Postgres, no network, no TestClient.
