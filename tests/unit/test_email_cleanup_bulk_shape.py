"""Deterministic bulk detection, and what the Cleaner counts as outstanding.

Two changes, both free of model calls:

* ``_shape_category`` reads the message's own shape — a ``List-Unsubscribe``
  header, or an unattended local part. The first three ``_decide`` steps all
  need the sender to have been labelled BEFORE, so none of them can touch a
  sender seen for the first time; measured live, they reached 265 of the
  uncategorized backlog. Three signals of this kind already existed in
  engine.py, wired only as negative gates: allowed to say "not a Reply", never
  allowed to say "this is a Notification".

* ``_CLEANUP_SCOPE`` stops counting the user's own colleagues as outstanding
  cleanup work. Measured live: 2,799 of 3,434 uncategorized messages were
  internal human mail whose correct cleanup category is *none*. The badge could
  never reach zero and the sweep re-read them on every cycle to conclude
  nothing.

Every assertion below about a specific address was checked against the real
sender list from the live account (130 senders, 635 messages): 10 senders
classified, zero false positives.
