"""Org administration routes (prefix ``/admin``) plus ``/auth/me``.

Members, groups, roles, and per-user access overrides for the multi-user
organization model. Spec: ``project-docs/specs/org_access_control.md``
(+ ``department_centers.md`` §3 Phase B for groups).

Layout mirrors ``routes/apps/``: ``_common`` is the leaf (DB, org lookup,
invariants) and the feature modules import from it, never from each other.
