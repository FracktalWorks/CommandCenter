"""Automatic speaker identification — name diarized speakers from self-intros.

Diarization gives anonymous labels (S1/S2/…). Very often a speaker says their
own name early on ("Hi, I'm Priya", "This is Alex speaking", "Sam here"). This
module runs an LLM extraction pass over the diarized transcript to map each
label → the name that speaker states about THEMSELVES, and writes the result
into ``meeting.speaker_names`` (the same map the manual rename UI edits, resolved
to real names at summary/prompt/email time).

Design:
- **Precision over recall.** A name is assigned ONLY when the *same* speaker
  self-introduces; being addressed by another speaker ("thanks, Alex") never
  names anyone. Unsure → left anonymous.
- **Non-destructive.** Merges into existing ``speaker_names``; a name the user
  already set is never overwritten (unless ``overwrite=True``). So running it
  can't clobber manual corrections.
- **Fail-safe.** Any problem (no diarization, LLM error, bad JSON) returns the
  existing map unchanged and never raises — callers can wrap the pipeline around
  it safely.

Spec: note_taker_app.md §3.5 (named speakers).
