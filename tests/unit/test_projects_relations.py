"""WS-27p — dependencies and subtasks, made reachable.

Spec: `ai-company-brain/specs/project_management_app.md` §11.2 item 8, §11.14.

*"`pm_task_links` and `parent_task_id` both exist, unreachable from the board.
Data with no surface is a promise the product does not keep."*

Both halves were genuinely unreachable, and for different reasons: links could
be created and deleted since WS-27a but never LISTED (`get_task` returns a
*count*), and subtasks could be created from the panel but never listed either.

The claims worth pinning:

* **`blocks` may not form a cycle.** `assert_no_task_cycle` has guarded
  `parent_task_id` since WS-27a and the same hazard sat unguarded on links. A
  blocks B blocks C blocks A is a deadlock no human can resolve by finishing
  something, and every walk over it runs forever.
* **only `blocks` is guarded.** A cycle in `relates_to` is redundant, not
  harmful, and refusing one would be a rule with no failure to prevent.
* **"blocked" means a blocker that is still OPEN.** A done blocker blocks
  nothing, and a task that stays red after its dependency shipped is a task
  people learn to ignore.
* **progress counts the CATEGORY**, not `completed_at` — a project can name its
  finished lane anything, and `cancelled` is resolved even though nothing was
  completed.
