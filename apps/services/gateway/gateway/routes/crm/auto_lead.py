"""CRM · auto_lead — an unknown inbound sender becomes a lead (WS-26d-autolead).

Spec: ``project-docs/specs/crm_app.md`` §9 ``WS-26d-autolead`` · D-CRM-9 ·
D-CRM-12. Migration: ``crm_auto_lead_cursors``.

**This module registers no routes.** Like ``broker_handlers``, it is deliberately
absent from ``routes/crm/__init__.py``: its one entry point,
:func:`create_leads_from_new_mail`, is called from the email app's shared
new-mail hook (``routes/email/scheduler_hooks.py::process_new_mail``) — the one
seam the background scheduler, the manual-sync route and the Graph webhook all
funnel through, so mail is considered identically however it arrived.

**It lives in ``routes/crm`` and not in the email package** because what it
does is write a CRM record: it owns a CRM cursor table, it goes through the
CRM's own service write path, and it is gated by a CRM owner gate. It borrows
the email automation package's PUBLIC identity primitives
(``sender_scope`` / ``resolve_org_domains`` / ``normalize_domain``) rather than
copying them — D-CRM-4 declined to import another route package's *private*
helper, and "is this person a colleague?" already has one public answer across
the automation package. A third copy of it here would be the drift the rule
exists to prevent.

Five properties are load-bearing, and each one is a way this feature can do
real damage rather than merely be wrong:

1. **The flag is read BEFORE the step is entered.** ``CRM_AUTO_LEAD`` ships OFF
   and :func:`auto_lead_enabled` is its single definition, but the *call site*
   is what is guarded — with the flag off this module opens no session, issues
   no query and creates nothing, and ``process_new_mail`` does not even import
   :func:`create_leads_from_new_mail`. (It does import *this module* to read
   the predicate; that is one ``sys.modules`` lookup after boot, because
   ``routes/crm`` is mounted by ``main.py`` regardless. One definition of what
   the flag means is worth more than saving it — two places that must agree
   about a flag is how a loop runs with the flag off.)

2. **THREE cursor facts, and they answer three different questions.**
   ``process_new_mail`` is also reached by deep resyncs and by the first-ever
   sync of a newly connected mailbox, and neither marks the mail it classifies
   as history.

   * ``activated_at`` — the start of the CURRENT ON epoch.
     ``received_at > activated_at`` is the backfill discriminator: mail that
     ARRIVED before this epoch began mints nothing, whenever it is classified.
   * ``processed_watermark`` — the incremental cursor over
     ``rules_processed_at``.
   * ``last_run_at`` — when this step last RAN. It is what detects dormancy,
     and on a gap it CLAMPS ``activated_at`` forward to
     ``now - REANCHOR_GAP_SECONDS`` rather than resetting it, so the OFF/outage
     backlog stays excluded while the message that woke the step survives.
     ⚠️ The step is invoked only when a sync PERSISTED mail
     (``email_ingestion/scheduler.py:463-472``), never once per period, so this
     column trips overnight and over weekends routinely — which is why
     re-anchoring has to be cheap. See :func:`_reanchor_if_dormant`.

   Without the first, connecting a second mailbox mints a lead per unknown
   sender in a year of mail — each born ``zoho_dirty`` and queued for the live
   Zoho tenant within one 600s cycle.

3. **"Unknown" is three questions, and "external" is only necessary.**
   :func:`_is_unknown_sender` mirrors ``senders._maybe_block_cold``'s two steps
   (the cold-sender memo, then "have we ever emailed them") and adds a third
   (no ``crm_contacts`` / ``crm_leads`` row already carries the address).
   Separately, :func:`_is_external_sender` runs TWO gates, because
   ``sender_scope`` fails SAFE to ``"external"`` — the wrong direction here. A
   lead row for your own CFO, pushed into the live Zoho tenant, is what the
   second gate exists to prevent, and it is SUFFIX-aware: a colleague on
   ``mail.fracktal.in`` is a colleague.

4. **The first activity is metadata, never content** (D-CRM-12 applied to what
   a machine writes). ``type='system'`` — deliberately outside the Zoho push
   predicate, so the activity never leaves the native CRM — subject and sender
   in ``meta``, and ``body`` empty. Sender + subject is the proportionate
   disclosure for a cold inbound inquiry on an org-visible record; the mail
   body is not, and no snippet of it is either. This module never reads
   ``body_text`` or ``snippet``.

5. **The watermark advances over the successful PREFIX only.** A failure is not
   a reason to skip work: the step opens a second session per lead (through
   ``create_record``) while holding the batch's own, so pool exhaustion fails
   many candidates at once, and an unconditional advance would step over every
   one of them permanently. On the first lead-write failure the cursor stops
   moving and the cycle logs ``sync.auto_lead_stalled`` at WARNING every cycle
   until a human looks. That trades silent loss for a visible stall on a poison
   head message, deliberately: fail closed toward the CRM.

**One race is accepted and recorded** (spec §9): two concurrent
``process_new_mail`` invocations for one account can read the same watermark
and double-mint. The cost is one visible, hand-deletable duplicate lead. The
fix that suggests itself — a UNIQUE index on ``crm_leads.email`` — is a
deploy-blocking constraint on a column where 1,516 imported rows may already
carry duplicates, which is exactly the shape migration 148 had to defuse. Do
not add it.

#:
#: ⚠️ **This is not "six scheduler periods".** The step does not run once per
#: period: ``email_ingestion/scheduler.py:463-472`` fires the hook only when a
#: sync actually persisted mail, so a quiet mailbox does not run it at all.
#: What this measures is therefore "how long since mail last arrived AND was
#: processed", which on a real mailbox means it trips overnight and over
#: weekends as a matter of course. That is precisely why the re-anchor clamps
#: instead of resetting: tripping has to be cheap, because it is routine.
#:
#: One hour is the trade. Larger admits more of a genuine OFF window's backlog;
#: smaller starts excluding mail that arrived during an ordinary evening lull
#: just before the message that woke the step.
#:
#: The guard itself is not optional: ``activated_at`` alone stops a deep
#: resync, but it does nothing about a flag that was on, turned off for four
#: weeks, and turned back on — the cursor still carries day-1's anchor, so the

    ``activated_at`` guards a deep RESYNC. It does nothing about a flag that
    was on, turned off for four weeks and turned back on — the cursor still
    carries the old anchor, so the first ON cycle would mint the whole OFF
    window at once, unattended, into a live tenant (27 leads, measured).

    **The anchor is clamped to ``now - REANCHOR_GAP_SECONDS``, not set to
    ``now``, and the batch still runs.** Both halves of that are load-bearing,
    and the first version of this function got both wrong for the same reason:
    it assumed the step is invoked once per scheduler period. **It is not.**
    ``email_ingestion/scheduler.py:463-472`` reads ``synced`` off the sync
    result and calls the hook **only when mail was actually persisted**, so a
    mailbox with no new mail does not run this step at all — which means the
    cycle that trips the dormancy test is *always* the cycle carrying the
    message that woke it. Resetting the anchor to ``now`` and returning early
    therefore excluded that message permanently: no mail 22:00→07:30, a cold
    prospect writes at 07:30:50, the step runs at 07:31:05, and the one lead it
    existed to catch fell a quarter-minute the wrong side of its own anchor.
    Every night, every weekend.

    Clamping keeps the fail-closed property that matters — anything received
    longer ago than the gap width stays excluded, so a real OFF window or a
    multi-day outage still mints nothing from its backlog — while admitting
    everything received inside the last ``REANCHOR_GAP_SECONDS``, which is
    where the triggering message always is.

    ⚠️ **Documented residual:** mail received in the final hour of an OFF
    window IS minted when the flag comes back on. It is bounded by TIME, not by
    one batch — one gap-width of mail (an hour), drained across however many
    cycles the per-cycle cap takes — and it is the deliberate price of never
    dropping the message that woke the step. `crm_app.md` §9 records it and
    ``work_plan.md`` §6 (b) tells the owner about it before they flip.

    ``last_run_at`` rather than ``processed_watermark`` is still the clock
    here, but the honest reason is narrower than first claimed: both freeze on
    a mailbox that receives nothing, since neither advances when the hook never
    fires. What separates them is a cycle that ran and found no *candidates* —
    mail that landed outside the inbox, or was held back, or predates the
    anchor. That cycle advances ``last_run_at`` and not the watermark, and it
    is also exactly the state a deliberate stall (property 5) holds the
    watermark in; keying dormancy on the watermark would re-anchor past a stall
