"""CRM · auto-lead from inbound email (WS-26d-autolead).

Spec: ``project-docs/specs/crm_app.md`` §9 ``WS-26d-autolead`` —
done-when 1-7, each named in a test below · D-CRM-9 · D-CRM-12.

**What this file is defending.** With ``CRM_AUTO_LEAD`` on, a scheduler hook
writes CRM records with no human in the loop, and by D-CRM-9 each one is born
``zoho_dirty`` and reaches the LIVE Zoho tenant within one 600s sync cycle.
There is no confirmation card on a scheduler hook and there is no delete tool.
So the tests that matter are the ones about what it must NOT do:

* ``test_dw2_*`` — with the flag off the step is not entered. Asserted twice:
  once at runtime (a sentinel that raises if it is called) and once
  structurally (the call is lexically inside an ``if auto_lead_enabled()``), so
  a future refactor that moves the gate INSIDE the step fails here rather than
  quietly opening a database session per mailbox per cycle.
* ``test_dw7_*`` — a deep resync of a newly connected mailbox mints NOTHING.
  ``process_new_mail`` is reached by ~1-year backfills that stamp no
  held-back marker, so "everything classified" would mint a lead per unknown
  sender across a year of mail.
* ``test_dw5_*`` — colleague, self and already-known senders create nothing.
  Two colleague cases, because there are two gates and they answer different
  questions: same-domain is ``sender_scope``'s, a configured second org domain
  is the internal-domain list's.
* ``test_dw6_*`` — the lead IS born ``zoho_dirty`` (that is the design, not an
  accident), and its first activity's ``type='system'`` is asserted absent from
  ``sync_zoho``'s own push statement rather than from a comment about it.

Hermetic, in ``test_crm_routes.py``'s convention: no Postgres, no network, no
TestClient; the step is called directly with ``_get_db`` monkeypatched onto the
SUT submodules against the shared ``_crm_fakes.FakeCrmDB``. The real settings
object is never mutated — the ON state is the module's own
``auto_lead_enabled`` predicate, monkeypatched, exactly as
``test_crm_zoho_sync.py`` does for ``sync_enabled``.
