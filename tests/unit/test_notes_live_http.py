"""HTTP-level test of the live path the in-browser recorder actually drives.

The unit tests cover the bus and registry as functions; this drives the real
FastAPI routes end to end — POST a caption exactly as `postLiveSegment()` does,
then read it back off the roster and the SSE stream. It's the surface the
recording screen hits, so a routing/auth/serialisation regression shows up here
rather than in the browser.

No database: these three routes are pure in-memory (presence lives in Postgres
and is covered separately), which is also why on-page live transcription works
the moment the app is deployed.
