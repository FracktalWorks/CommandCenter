"""Contact-card signature parsing — the card must not invent contact details.

The people card behind a sender's name reads phone/title/company out of the
sender's own signature. That parse is the only place the card guesses, so it is
pinned here from both directions: it finds what a real signature carries, and it
stays silent on order numbers, dates, and quoted replies (where the "signature"
belongs to whoever was being replied TO, not to the sender).
