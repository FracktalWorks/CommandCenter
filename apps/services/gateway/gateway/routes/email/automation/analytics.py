"""Automation · analytics — what the mailbox says you should do about it.

The old ``/analytics/overview`` answered "what is in my mailbox?" — a question
the sidebar already answers. Worse, it answered it dishonestly: the page header
read "last 30 days" while ``total``/``unread``/``top_senders``/``by_folder``
carried no date predicate at all, so on the live account the cards showed 6,803
and 4,517 (everything back to 2019) under a 30-day heading whose real figures
were 1,431 and 739. Only the volume chart moved when the range selector moved.

So every number here is scoped to the window, and the two that deliberately are
NOT — the reply backlogs, which are a standing state rather than a flow — say
"right now" in their own labels rather than borrowing the window's.

The organising rule for what earns a place: **a metric ships only if a user can
act on it.** Read-rate, starred count and attachment count were dropped for
failing that test; per-folder counts were dropped for duplicating the sidebar.
What replaced them is response behaviour (are you answering people?), the reply
backlogs (who is blocked on you), and the senders you are paying attention to
without ever replying — which is exactly the Email Cleaner's input.

    ``trust`` is the half nobody ships. Counting how many emails were filed is
    reassurance; what the user actually needs to decide is whether to keep
    letting it file them, and that lives in three numbers: how often they
    overruled it, how often the provider call failed, and how many learned
    patterns are queued up unreviewed. That last one is not decoration — an
    unreviewed pattern is inert by design (the Email Cleaner will not project
    it), so a growing queue means the assistant is quietly getting less useful,
    and a batch of bad patterns sitting in it is exactly what went unnoticed
    until 24 of 45 had to be purged by hand.
