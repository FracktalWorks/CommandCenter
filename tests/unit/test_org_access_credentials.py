"""Org access control — per-user integration credentials and org memory.

Spec: ``project-docs/specs/org_access_control.md`` §5 seam 3.

Two things are being protected here, and they fail in opposite directions:

* **Credentials must not over-reach.** An agent declaring an integration in
  its ``config.json`` must not thereby hand a member a service they are not
  authorised for.
* **Credentials must not under-reach.** A background run (cron, reconciler,
  webhook) has no acting member, and must keep every credential it had before
  org access control existed. A filter that quietly starves those runs is a
  worse outage than the leak it prevents, because nothing 403s — the work just
  silently stops happening.
