"""CRM · the stage-metadata repair — WS-26f f1 + f4.

Spec: ``ai-company-brain/specs/crm_app.md`` §5.1 (system 1) · ticket WS-26f
done-when 1-4 · decisions D-CRM-10 and D-CRM-11.

Hermetic: no Postgres, no network, no Zoho. The route function is called
directly with ``core._get_db`` monkeypatched onto each SUT submodule (the
``_crm_fakes`` convention) and ``import_zoho._client`` bound to
:class:`FakeTenant` — ONE seam, shared with the record importer, which is why
this file binds the same attribute ``test_crm_zoho_import.py`` does.

⚠️ **The dirty-bypass is pinned STATICALLY, against the statement's own text.**
``_crm_fakes.FakeCrmDB`` re-implements clauses in Python, so a behavioural
"nothing was dirtied" case there can only ever be the mirror agreeing with
itself about a column it never wrote. The claim that matters — f4's UPDATE
never travels through ``core.update_row`` and therefore never reaches
``mark_dirty_on_update`` — is a property of the SQL and of the module's call
graph, and is asserted against both. The behavioural cases below say what the
mirror CAN see: which rows changed, and which columns on them.
