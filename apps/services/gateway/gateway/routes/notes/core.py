"""Note Taker routes — shared kernel.

The shared ``router``, Pydantic models, DB session factory and row→model
mappers used by the meetings/recordings/pipeline modules. Mirrors
``routes/tasks/core.py`` (the leaf module: it imports nothing from siblings).

Canonical store: the ``meeting`` / ``meeting_recording`` / ``transcript_segment``
/ ``meeting_note`` / ``summary_run`` / ``action_item`` tables
(``infra/postgres/01_schema.sql`` + ``95_note_taker.sql``; spec:

# context — bound once in `_with_resolved_access` — so no call site passes
# one (H2). A call outside a bound request raises `TenantUnbound` rather than
# defaulting: fail closed, never "the usual org". `_get_db` above remains for
# the sites H2 cannot reach from a request: background jobs/pollers and the
# meeting-bot worker's service-identity paths (H4 threads their tenant).

# ── DB (the one shared gateway engine — gateway/db.py, BO-10) ────────────────
#
# This package used to build its own engine here with its own 5+10 pool. It now
# has none: `_get_db` / `_get_session_factory` at the top of this module are
# re-exports of the shared seam. The private names are kept so that every
# `from .core import _get_db` in this package — and every test that
# monkeypatches `_get_db` on the sibling module it is imported into — keeps
# working unchanged.


# ── Ownership — one predicate, one loader ────────────────────────────────────

#: The owner scope, as SQL, written ONCE. Every by-id endpoint that must not
#: reach a colleague's meeting binds this rather than spelling the comparison
#: out, so the two halves of the rule cannot drift apart:
#:
#: * ``lower(...) = lower(...)`` because ``owner_email`` is stamped verbatim
#:   from ``X-User-Email`` and an IdP may return the same UPN with different
#:   casing between sessions (Entra ID does). Byte equality would fail closed —
#:   a member's own library would silently empty — which is the "locked out of
#:   my own work" shape, not a leak, but it is still a defect.
#: * ``IS NULL`` stays visible to everyone: those are pre-migration-95 legacy
#:   rows (the column arrived nullable). Both insert paths stamp an owner, so
#:   the set cannot grow, and excluding them would hide a member's own old
#:   meetings rather than protect anybody.
#:
#: Requires the ``meeting`` table to be aliased ``m`` and binds ``:owner``.

    "(lower(m.owner_email) = lower(:owner) OR m.owner_email IS NULL)"
