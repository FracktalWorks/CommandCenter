"""CRM · stage_metadata — repairing the pipeline from Zoho's own settings.

Spec: ``project-docs/specs/crm_app.md`` §5.1 (system 1) · ticket WS-26f
f1 + f4 · decisions D-CRM-10 (probability) and D-CRM-11 (one pipeline).

    POST /crm/import/zoho/stages            → dry run: the full report, no writes
    POST /crm/import/zoho/stages?apply=true → the same report, applied

**Why this module exists.** ``import_zoho.ensure_status`` appends a stage Zoho
has and we do not past the last ``position`` with ``probability = 0`` — the
right refusal at import time, the wrong place to leave the data forever. 144's
six seed lanes are *renamed* variants of Zoho's defaults, so name-match missed
the tenant's real stages and the board reads as seed lanes (some empty)
followed by whatever order the importer first encountered. The tenant's true
lane order and forecast semantics live in the settings API; this reads them.

**The three properties that make it safe to hand to an owner:**

1. **Dry-run by default.** ``?apply=true`` is the write, and that exact string
   is the registered owner gate (``work_plan.md`` §6). A dry run issues no
   INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE and never commits — not "no rows", no *statements*.
2. **More than one pipeline STOPS the run, applied or not** (D-CRM-11). A
   name-match repair against the wrong pipeline scrambles the board it was
   meant to fix, so the decision goes back to the owner first. The stop returns
   before the database is opened at all.
3. **No deal row is touched by the stage repair.** Statuses are native config
   and are absent from ``core.ZOHO_TRACKED_TABLES``, so the repair queues zero
   Zoho pushes. The one deal-row write in this module is f4's ``closed_at``
   proxy, which is a **direct UPDATE** precisely so it does not travel through
   ``core.update_row`` → ``mark_dirty_on_update``: routing 500+ imported deals
   through the dirty-marking path would queue that many no-op pushes into the
   live Zoho tenant on the next sync cycle.

**The Zoho read is reached through ``import_zoho._client()``** rather than a
second seam of its own, so a test binds ONE fake tenant for the importer and
for this.
