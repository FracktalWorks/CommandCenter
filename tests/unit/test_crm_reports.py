"""CRM · forecast & funnel reports — WS-26g.

Spec: ``ai-company-brain/specs/crm_app.md`` §5.1 system 2 · ticket WS-26g.

Hermetic: no Postgres, no network. The route functions are called directly with
``core._get_db`` monkeypatched onto each SUT submodule (the ``_crm_fakes``
convention).

**How the aggregates are read, and why it is not a mirror agreeing with
itself.** ``reports.py`` emits no ``GROUP BY``: every aggregate is a per-key
query in the shape ``pipeline.get_pipeline`` already uses, which
``_crm_fakes.FakeCrmDB`` answers through ``_weighted`` — and ``_weighted``
reads the summed EXPRESSION out of the statement text (which column is summed,
which column falls back to which bound parameter, what it is divided by) rather
than reproducing it in Python. So perturbing ``core.WEIGHTED_SQL`` changes the
answer here. The set-shaped questions (visited sets, medians, orphan names) are
answered in Python by the route over rows the fake returns verbatim, so those
tests exercise the real code and nothing about them is restated in the fake.

⚠️ No aggregation answer is hard-coded into the fake, and none may be: that is
what would turn "fixture tests proving the math" into a mirror.
