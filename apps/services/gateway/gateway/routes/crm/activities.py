"""CRM · activities — the timeline: notes, calls, meetings, follow-up tasks.

Spec: ``ai-company-brain/specs/crm_app.md`` §3.8, §4 (``activities.py`` row).

    GET    /crm/<entity>/{id}/timeline     activities + status changes, merged
    POST   /crm/<entity>/{id}/activities   log a note / call / meeting / task
    PATCH  /crm/activities/{aid}           edit a note, complete a task
    DELETE /crm/activities/{aid}

A deal's timeline **unions its originating lead's history**, labelled with the
source, because everything said before conversion was said about this deal —
losing it at the conversion boundary is the failure the ``lead_id`` provenance
column exists to prevent (§5.3).

Email threads are the third source (WS-26d-email), joined by address with no
link table (D-CRM-5). ⚠️ **That join is CALLER-scoped, never record-scoped**:
the CRM is org-visible to every ``feature:crm`` holder (D-CRM-3) while a
mailbox belongs to one person, so the timeline shows email *the caller can
already read*, not email *the record has*. Two holders opening the same lead
may legitimately see different threads, and a holder with no mailbox sees
none. That is why :func:`_timeline` takes the caller.

Paths are written out per entity for the same reason as ``records.py``: a
generic ``/crm/{entity}/{id}/…`` template would make route registration order
load-bearing, and ``PATCH /crm/activities/{aid}`` sits at the depth it would
compete with.

    their deletes so the sync propagates them; activities do not, in either

    survives here. Accepted v1 cost: an activity is an append-mostly log entry
    whose stale copy misleads nobody about the pipeline, and Zoho is being
    retired. Do not "fix" one direction alone — a native tombstone without the
    matching Zoho→native delete would make the two sides disagree in a new way.
