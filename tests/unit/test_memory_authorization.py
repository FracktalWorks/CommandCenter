"""You may touch your own memory scope, and no one else's.

Spec: ``docs/multiplayer/memory-clearance.md`` §2.1,
``docs/multiplayer/README.md`` §8 (Phase 0).

``/memory/{scope}`` was guarded only by ``require_internal_auth``, which proves
the caller IS THE PLATFORM. The Next.js BFF is the platform, on behalf of every
signed-in user — it forwards the internal token together with the caller's
identity headers. So the gate excluded outsiders and nobody else: any member
could read, search, or delete a colleague's private memories by putting their
email in a URL.

The path parameter is a scope key (``acb_memory.scope_key``), so the properties
are per scope shape:

1. **Your own email is yours**, and somebody else's is a 403 — including for
   admins, because administering members is not reading what they told an agent
   in private.
2. **Agent memory** is shared across the agent's users by design, so it is
   gated on the same ``agents:run:<name>`` the run path enforces.
3. **Org memory** reads on ``memory:read_org`` and writes on
   ``memory:write_org`` — the permissions migration 131 seeded.
4. **An unrecognised scope is refused**, so a vocabulary that grows fails
   closed instead of quietly becoming world-readable.
5. **Deleting checks the memory is in the scope**, not just that the scope is
   yours — otherwise naming your own scope and a colleague's memory id deletes
   their memory, which is the same IDOR one level down.
