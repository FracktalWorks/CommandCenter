"""The gateway's ONE CSV writer — RFC 4180, BOM, and formula neutralisation.

Every filtered-list export in this service renders through here: Projects'
``GET /projects/export/tasks.csv`` (WS-27ae) and the CRM's
``GET /crm/export/{entity}.csv`` (WS-26i-export).

It lives beside ``gateway/db.py`` rather than inside either route package
because it belongs to neither: the second app to want a CSV is the moment a
copy would appear, and the thing that would be copied is a **security
control**. :func:`csv_cell` is the difference between a spreadsheet and remote
code execution on the machine of whoever double-clicks the file; a second copy
is one that does not get the next fix (CLAUDE.md §4, "a second implementation
of an existing seam is a defect, not a feature").

Fences: ``tests/unit/test_projects_export.py`` and
``tests/unit/test_crm_export.py`` — the first pins the bytes of the guard, the
second pins that the CRM route actually applies it.

#: A cell that is exactly a number — the one thing that may keep a leading ``-``.

#: Without this exemption an estimate of ``-30`` would export as ``'-30`` and
#: every numeric column would arrive in the spreadsheet as text, which breaks
#: the sums people export a CSV to compute. A bare number is not a formula:

def csv_cell(value: Any) -> str:
    """One value → the text that goes in the cell, formula-neutralised.

    **The decision, stated so it can be argued with rather than discovered:** a
    cell whose first character is one of :data:`FORMULA_LEADERS` is prefixed
    with a single apostrophe. A record named ``=SUM(A1:A9)`` exports as
    ``'=SUM(A1:A9)``.

    Why a prefix and not "quote it": quoting does **not** help — Excel evaluates
    the cell after the CSV quoting is stripped, which is why `csv.QUOTE_ALL` is
    not a mitigation for this at all. Why guard rather than document: the values
    here are counterparty-authored (task titles, tags, custom-field text, and on
    the CRM side 3,993 rows imported out of Zoho — thousands of strings nobody
    in this company typed), and the payoff is `=cmd|'/c calc'!A0`, which
    executes with the credentials of whoever double-clicks the file. That is
    arbitrary code execution on the accountant's laptop in exchange for a
    formatting nicety.

    Why the apostrophe is acceptable: it is **visible, reversible and one
    character**, so a person who genuinely wanted a formula can see what
    happened and delete it. A silently executing formula has no such tell.

    A bare number (:data:`_BARE_NUMBER`) is exempt — see its note.

    ``None`` is the empty cell, never the string ``"None"``.
