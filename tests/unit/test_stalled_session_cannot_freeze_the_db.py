"""One wedged handler must not be able to take the database down.

The 2026-08-06 outage, and the three independent bounds that now stop it
recurring. Worth stating the chain once, because every assertion below is a link
in it and each looks arbitrary on its own:

1. An LLM completion hung. ``acompletion`` was awaited with no wall-clock bound.
2. The caller held a SQLAlchemy ``AsyncSession`` across that await. A session
   opens a transaction on first ``execute()`` and holds it until
   commit/rollback/close, so the hung call parked a Postgres transaction
   `idle in transaction` — holding ACCESS SHARE on ``email_assistant_settings``
   — for 14h44m.
3. ``apply_migrations.sh`` asked for ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on that table to replay an
   idempotent ``ALTER TABLE``, and waited. Postgres's lock queue is FIFO, so
   every later reader queued behind the *waiting* ALTER — including the one the
   send path makes to read the account's signature. Sending mail stopped, and
   the connection pool drained behind the blocked readers.

Any ONE of these bounds breaks the chain. All three are here because the chain
had no bound at all, and the cheapest way for it to come back is for someone to
restore one link while the other two look fine.
