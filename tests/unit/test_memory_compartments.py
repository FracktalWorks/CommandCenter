"""What a run may read, and where its facts go.

Spec: ``docs/multiplayer/memory-clearance.md`` §3.1, §3.3, §3.4.

The acceptance test the spec asks for is at the QUERY layer, not the answer
layer: assert that ``search()`` is never *called* with a compartment the room
is not cleared for — not that the answer avoids mentioning it. "Don't mention
Falcon" in a system prompt is a request; not passing the scope key is a
boundary, and only the second is testable.

1. **Solo is byte-identical.** Same scopes, same order, same write target as
   before compartments existed — a room of one has an intersection of one.
2. **A room reads the room, never a person.** No participant's private
   compartment is in the set, including the owner's and the typer's.
3. **Preferences travel, episodic facts do not.** The split is what makes a
   shared room usable rather than amnesiac.
4. **Facts learned in a room are written to the room.**
5. **The clearance fingerprint changes when the clearance does** — the cache
   key depends on it, and a stale key would serve a solo block to a room.
