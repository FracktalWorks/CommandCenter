/**
 * The room header — who is here, what the agents can reach, and the way in.
 *
 * Quiet while you are alone: a solo conversation renders one Share button and
 * nothing else, because a person working by themselves should not be told
 * repeatedly that they are working by themselves.
 *
 * Loud about exactly one thing: the capability cap. When a room's agents have
 * lost an integration because of who is in the room, that has to be stated
 * where the work happens, not filed in a settings page. Privacy and permission
 * that live only in a settings page are neither.
