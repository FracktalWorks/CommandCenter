"""Folder-scoped quick-filter facets, and ONE definition of "uncategorized".

Two things are pinned here:

1. The inbox chip row is driven by what a folder actually contains, so it can't
   offer "Cold Email" in Sent — a filter guaranteed to return nothing, whose
   empty result the user can't distinguish from a broken one.

2. "Uncategorized" means the same mail in the inbox chip and in the Email
   Cleaner's Uncategorized tab. Two definitions of it across two views of one
   mailbox is exactly the drift this package keeps paying down, so the SQL lives
   in core and both sides import it.
