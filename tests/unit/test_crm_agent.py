"""The CRM assistant agent (WS-26d) — registration, routes, verb + path fences.

Spec: ``project-docs/specs/crm_app.md`` §6 (Agent, Phase D) + §9 WS-26d.
The write tools' own behaviour — confirm-before-write, fail-closed, payload
shapes — lives in ``test_crm_agent_write.py``; what is asserted HERE is the
whole-surface properties, which is why every one of them enumerates ``_TOOLS``
rather than a hand-typed list of tool names.

Three properties carry this slice, and each has failed in this repo before:

1. **An agent that is not in BOTH registries silently never loads.**
   ``build_agents()`` alone is not registration (``_AGENT_REGISTRY`` is what
   ``local_path`` comes from, and what the orchestrator imports for its
   delegation tools); a registry entry alone is not an agent. The
   agent-orchestrator wrapper shipped with the second half missing and was
   unreachable for weeks — ``test_orchestrator_registration.py`` exists because
   of it. Both halves are asserted here.
2. **Every gateway call names the person it is for, or does not happen.**
   ``acb_auth/deps.py`` §1b reads a bearer with no ``X-User-Email`` as the
   platform acting as itself and grants SERVICE_ACCESS, so a run that cannot
   resolve its user must refuse rather than call. Asserted at the transport,
   with a fake httpx client, so the real ``_headers()`` runs — **for all eight
   tools**, because a write issued as the platform itself is the worse half of
   that bug.
3. **The verb allowlist is a property of the transport, not a promise in a
   docstring.** WS-26d-write widened it from ``{"GET"}`` to
   ``{"GET", "POST", "PATCH"}`` — and the check survived the widening, which is
   the part worth testing: ``DELETE`` and ``PUT`` still raise inside the one
   round-trip helper every tool goes through, so a tool added later cannot
   remove or replace a record. Asserted behaviourally (a DELETE raises),
   structurally (no ``_delete``/``_put`` helper exists for one to reach for),
   and by observation (every call the eight tools actually make is in the set).

Plus the WhatsApp half of the ticket: ``"crm"`` is a KNOWN entity-ref system so
a hand-set ref parses — and **nothing more**. The ``crm`` context block stays
``None``, which is what makes this parse-only rather than a link.

The agent module is loaded by file path (as the Dynamic Agent Loader does), not
as an installed package. No gateway and no MAF runtime are started.
