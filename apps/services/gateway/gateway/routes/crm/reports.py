"""CRM · reports — forecast, funnel, win/loss and the owner leaderboard.

Spec: ``ai-company-brain/specs/crm_app.md`` §5.1 system 2 · ticket WS-26g.

    GET /crm/reports/pipeline    per open/ongoing stage: count, ₹, ₹ weighted
    GET /crm/reports/funnel      per stage: entered, conversion-forward %,
                                 median dwell days over DEPARTURES

    GET /crm/reports/owners      per owner: open deals, ₹ weighted, ₹ won 90d

**Read-only.** Nothing here writes a row, reaches Zoho, reads a flag or needs a
migration: every number is a query over what ``crm_status_changes``,
``crm_deals`` and the two status vocabularies have carried since WS-26a.

Four facts about the DATA decide the shape of every query below, and each was
established by reading the rows rather than the prose.

1. **``crm_status_changes`` logs TRANSITIONS only.** ``records.create_record``
   writes no row and ``import_zoho`` writes none either, so all 551 imported
   deals have zero log rows and a deal's FIRST stage never appears as a
   ``to_status``. The funnel's "entered" is therefore a VISITED-SET union —
   every ``from_status``, every ``to_status``, and the deal's CURRENT stage name
   — not a count of ``to_status`` rows, which would report an empty funnel for
   the entire live board.
2. **The log stores status NAMES, not ids**, deliberately (migration 144: "an
   analytics row that stops meaning anything when somebody tidies the pipeline
   is not a log"). So every funnel join is a name join — and
   ``PATCH /crm/statuses/{kind}/{id}``, which WS-26f's settings grid puts in
   front of the owner, RENAMES a lane and orphans that name's whole history.
   Orphans are tallied into :attr:`FunnelReport.unmatched`, never dropped: a
   number that silently shrank when somebody fixed a typo is worse than no
   number.
3. **``entity_type = 'deal'`` is not optional on those reads.** The lead and
   deal status vocabularies are independent tables and the Zoho importer mints
   names into both, so an unfiltered read pulls lead history into the deal
   funnel wherever two names collide.
4. **``closed_at`` is NULL on every imported closed deal** until the owner runs
   WS-26f f4's backfill — ``?apply=true``, an owner gate (`work_plan.md` §6)
   that has NOT been run. A NULL therefore falls OUTSIDE the trailing window:
   zeros, never an error, and never "closed today". The count of such deals is
   reported (:attr:`WinLossReport.closed_without_date`) so a zero win-rate on a
   board full of closed deals is explicable rather than mysterious.

**The weighted formula is imported, never retyped** (``core.WEIGHTED_SQL``).
``tests/unit/_crm_fakes.py::_WEIGHTED_SUM_RE`` reads the expression out of the
statement text so a drifted copy changes the tests' answer; a second copy here
is exactly what would defeat that.

**No ``GROUP BY`` is emitted, and that is a choice** (WS-26g asks for it to be
stated). Every aggregate is a per-key query in the shape
``pipeline.get_pipeline`` already uses, because the weighted expression binds
the LANE's own default as ``:stage_probability`` — a single grouped statement
would have to reach that value through a join and would no longer BE the
expression the parity fixture and the fake both read. The set-shaped questions
(visited sets, medians, orphan names) read their rows and are answered in
Python, where "a deal's visited set" is expressible at all. The cost is
O(stages) plus O(owners * stages) small aggregates over a 551-row table, and
the owner list is capped so the second term cannot run away on pathological
data.

    Read as rows and counted in Python rather than as a ``GROUP BY``: it is one

    vocabulary (see the docstring's GROUP BY note). Addresses are lowered and
    stripped — R10, email comparisons are case-insensitive on both sides — and
    :func:`_owner_scope`'s predicate carries the matching ``lower(trim(…))`` so
    the two cannot group differently.

    ⚠️ The ranking counts **every** deal, closed ones included, so a departed
    rep holding nothing but won/lost history can occupy a capped slot showing
    zeros. That is the honest reading of "who has the most in this table" and
    it is what the cheap read supports; ranking by open deals would need each
    row's stage type, i.e. a second read of the whole table to order a list
    that is 2-3 long in practice. Said plainly here because the earlier wording
    ("least in play") described a rule this does not implement.

    ⚠️ A NULL is its own key and an empty string is a DIFFERENT one, on
    purpose. Collapsing the two here would be a tally SQL cannot reproduce:
    :func:`_owner_scope` can express "``owner_email IS NULL``" or
    "``lower(owner_email) = :owner``", and the fake refuses an unreadable
    predicate rather than quietly matching every row — so a combined bucket
    would have to be spelled as an OR the aggregate cannot bind, and would

    ⚠️ **``trim()`` here is not tidiness — it is what makes this predicate agree

    ``'vj@fracktal.in'`` and ``'vj@fracktal.in '`` are ONE owner in the tally.
