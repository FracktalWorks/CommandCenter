"""Shared in-memory progress tracking for the email background jobs.

Both the rule runner's "Process past emails" job and the cleaner's sweep publish
per-account progress that the UI polls (``/rules/process-past/status``,
``/cleanup/status``). Each is a dict-per-account in a module global, mutated by a
background task while a request handler reads it — fine, because uvicorn runs the
handler and its BackgroundTasks in the SAME worker process, so they share the
global.

The hazard both share is *clobbering*: a second run for the same account (a
retry, a double-click, a sweep starting while a backfill is mid-flight) would
overwrite the first run's row, and — worse — the FIRST run's late "finished"
write could then land on the SECOND run's row and mark the newer job done while
it is still going. The runner already guarded against this with a monotonic
token; the cleaner did not. This is that guard, in one place, for both.

Ephemeral by design: the state lives only in memory, so a process restart drops
it along with the jobs it describes — losing the tracker with the work is
correct, not a bug.
