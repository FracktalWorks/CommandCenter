"""``/auth/me``'s feature resolution — the answer the sidebar renders.

Filed after a real report: *"I do not have access to this in the UI."* Two
recently-registered panes were absent from the sidebar and there was no way,
from inside the product, to tell which of four causes it was — missing grant,
deny override, unregistered slug, or a code mirror that had gone stale against
the database. Every one of them renders as the same nothing.

What is locked here:

1. **The catalog is the registry, and the code list is a mirror.** A slug
   seeded by a migration is reachable even when the deployed ``acb_auth``
   predates it. That is the failure mode with no symptom: nothing errors, the
   pane is simply not there.
2. **The union, both ways.** A slug in code but not yet in the database is
   still reported, so a box mid-deploy does not lose panes either.
3. **This grants nothing.** The gate is ``require_feature_router`` on each
   router; everything here is a report about that same decision.
4. **Absence is explained.** ``features_denied`` names the permission each
   missing pane needs, which is what turns "the app doesn't have that" into
   something a person can act on.

Hermetic: pure function, real ``build_access``. No Postgres, no TestClient.
