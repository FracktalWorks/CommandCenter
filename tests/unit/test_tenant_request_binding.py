"""MT-1c / H2 — the request path binds its tenant once, centrally.

`saas_multitenancy_handover.md` H2: *"Add `bind_tenant(user.organization_id)`
in the gateway middleware / the app-wide dependency that already resolves
`UserContext`, and release it after the response. Then the 561 sites need no
tenant argument at all."*

The claims pinned here are the ones a refactor could silently lose:

* resolving an authenticated identity BINDS the tenant contextvar — this is
  what lets every converted `tenant_session()` call site take no argument;
* the tenant comes from the `app_user` row (`resolve_identity`), NEVER from a
  header the caller controls (R11) — asserted by construction: the fake
  resolver ignores the asserted role header entirely;
* an identity with no organization binds NOTHING, so a converted handler fails
  closed with `TenantUnbound` instead of defaulting to "the usual tenant";
* the `system:internal` service identity binds nothing — jobs bind their own
  tenant explicitly (H4) or fail closed;
* the gateway middleware opens a fresh scope per request and releases it after
  the response, so a binding cannot leak from one request into the next even
  on a server that reuses one task for sequential requests.

Hermetic: `resolve_access` / `resolve_identity` are monkeypatched; no DB.
