"""Email gateway routes (package).

Split out of a single 7k-line module into an acyclic layering:

    core        shared kernel: router, models, DB/provider infra, mappers
    transport   mail sync: accounts, folders, messages, send, oauth, webhook
    automation  inbox-zero layer: rules, drafting, categorization, reply-zero…
    digest      inbox digest (formerly email_digest.py)

The full historical import surface of ``gateway.routes.email`` is preserved:
every top-level name from the submodules is flattened into this package
namespace, so ``from gateway.routes.email import X`` and the scheduler/app/test
imports keep working unchanged. Submodules are imported in dependency order so
their routes register on the shared ``core.router``.

from gateway.routes.email import automation, core, digest, transport  # noqa: F401

# Flatten submodule namespaces into the package so the historical public surface
# (incl. private ``_helpers`` the scheduler/tests import by name) is preserved.
# NOTE: reassigned module globals (e.g. core._ENGINE) live on their submodule;
# read those via ``email.core.<name>``, not the flattened copy.
