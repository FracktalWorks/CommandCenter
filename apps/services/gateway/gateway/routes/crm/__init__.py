"""CRM route package — the gateway `/crm` API (native CRM, Zoho's successor).

Spec: ``project-docs/specs/crm_app.md`` (WS-26a builds §3 + §4).

Same layout as ``routes/tasks`` and ``routes/notes``: ``core`` is the leaf and
the feature modules register their routes on the shared ``router`` as an import
side effect.

Unlike ``routes/workflows``, **import order here is NOT load-bearing**: every
path in this package is a literal per entity (``/crm/leads/{id}``, never
``/crm/{entity}/{id}``), so no route can shadow another and alphabetising this
list can never change which handler answers a request. ``records`` imports
``pipeline`` for the status-transition semantics, which is why Python loads
``pipeline`` first either way.

``import_zoho`` (the Zoho backfill + the shared Zoho→native mapping) and
``sync_zoho`` (the two-way sync engine and its ``POST /crm/sync/zoho``) are
WS-26b. ``broker_handlers`` is deliberately NOT imported here: it registers no
routes, and ``main.py`` calls its ``register_crm_broker_handlers()`` directly
at startup exactly the way it calls the tasks app's.

``deal_contacts.py`` is WS-26c's API addendum — the read/write surface for
``crm_deal_contacts``, which 26a created and only the convert path ever wrote
to.

``stage_metadata.py`` is WS-26f — ``POST /crm/import/zoho/stages``, the
pipeline repair that reads the tenant's real lane order out of Zoho's settings
API. It is a sibling of ``import_zoho`` rather than part of it because it
imports records nowhere: it rewrites native config, and its one deal-row write
(the ``closed_at`` proxy) deliberately bypasses ``core.update_row``.

``export.py`` is WS-26i-export — ``GET /crm/export/{entity}.csv``, the
filtered-list CSV export. Read-only, no migration, and the one WS-26i item that
touches the live Zoho tenant not at all. Its ``export/`` segment comes FIRST for
the shadowing reason above: ``/crm/leads/export.csv`` would sit under
``/crm/leads/{record_id}``.

``reports.py`` is WS-26g — the four read-only ``/crm/reports/*`` blocks
(forecast by stage, funnel, win/loss, owner leaderboard) over
``crm_status_changes`` and ``crm_deals``. It writes nothing and adds no
migration; the weighted-₹ expression it shares with ``pipeline`` lives in
``core.WEIGHTED_SQL`` so there is exactly one copy of the formula.
