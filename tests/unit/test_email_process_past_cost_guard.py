"""Processing past emails is the one surface that spends a model call per
message on a range the user types into a date box.

Two things were missing between the picker and the Process button: a number, and
a ceiling. The only way to discover a range covered 4,000 emails was to spend
4,000 AI calls finding out — and once "Clean older mail" could pull a whole
43,000-message mailbox into the local store, an open-ended range stopped meaning
"a few thousand" and started meaning "everything ever received".

    "When processing past emails with AI, display a warning that extensive
     categorization can be costly; limit processing to a few months up to a
     year."                                                    — 2026-07-20

The cap is enforced in the API, not just the dialog: a bound that lives only in
the client is not a bound.
