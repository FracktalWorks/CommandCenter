"""CRM · deal contacts — who on the customer's side this deal runs through.

Spec: ``project-docs/specs/crm_app.md`` §3.5, §9 WS-26c done-when 2.

    GET    /crm/deals/{id}/contacts
    POST   /crm/deals/{id}/contacts               {contact_id, role?, is_primary?}
    DELETE /crm/deals/{id}/contacts/{contact_id}

WS-26a created ``crm_deal_contacts`` and wrote exactly one row into it, from
the convert path. Nothing could read the table, nothing could add a second
contact, and "at most one primary per deal" was true only because there was
never more than one row. This module is the read/write surface the record
sheet needs, and the primary rule now lives on the shared
``core.link_deal_contact`` seam that convert also goes through — so the rule
belongs to the table, not to whichever endpoint happened to write it.

There is deliberately **no** partial unique index behind it (§3.5): the WS-26b
importer sets primaries in a pass that would fight one. That makes the code
path the only enforcement, which is exactly why it is one path.
