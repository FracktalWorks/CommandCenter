// ── The store's one rule, under test ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// "A write re-reads what is on screen, whatever the response was." Every
// loader and every write path in store.ts is written to that rule, and until
// this file existed the rule was asserted only by the comments claiming it.
//
// That gap had already produced a live bug: `refreshCollection()` grew a
// `reports` branch whose comment named `moveDeal` as its caller, while
// `moveDeal` hard-coded `api.getPipeline` and never called
// `refreshCollection()` at all. The branch was unreachable from the one write
// it was written for, and nothing failed. So the cases below pin WHICH request
// a write issues, not merely that the store settled into a plausible shape —
// the store's job is deciding what to re-read, and asserting on final state
// alone cannot see a decision that was never made.
//
// `api` is mocked because these are the store's routing decisions, not the
// BFF client's (which `api.test.ts` covers).
