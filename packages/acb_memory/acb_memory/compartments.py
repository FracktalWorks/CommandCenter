"""Which memory compartments a run may read, and where its facts are written.

Spec: ``docs/multiplayer/memory-clearance.md`` §3.1 (compartments), §3.3 (the
clearance rule), §3.4 (the write rule).

A **compartment** is the unit of memory scoping — one Mem0 partition, one
audience. This module answers the only two questions a run needs:

* **What may this run read?** The clearance rule: *a run reads at the clearance
  of its least-cleared viewer.* Intersection, never union.
* **Where do its facts go?** The write rule: *no wider than the session they
  were learned in.*

Deliberately dependency-free. It knows nothing about rooms, participants, or
permissions — the caller resolves ``shared`` (the gateway already has
``resolve_room_access``) and this decides what follows from it. Keeping the
direction that way is what lets ``acb_memory`` stay below ``acb_auth`` and the
gateway in the import graph.

**What is here and what is not.** Room and preference compartments need no
registry: a room's audience is its participant list, which
``chat_session_participant`` already holds, and a person's preferences are
theirs. ``subject:`` compartments — "everything about the Falcon deal" — do
need the registry and the membership tables in §3.2, and are not built. The cut
is along the design's own grain rather than halfway through a feature.

    has an intersection of one, so the rule collapses to today's behaviour.

    **Shared** swaps the acting member's private compartment for the room's,
    and keeps their preferences:

    * ``room:<thread_id>`` — what this room has established. Its audience is
      the room's participants, so it needs no registry entry.
    * ``prefs:<actor>`` — how the person being answered likes to work. Safe to
      carry in because they are in the room and the facts describe them.

    What is absent is the point: no ``<actor>`` user compartment, in a room, for
