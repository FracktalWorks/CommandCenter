"""Outbound HTML-signature assembly.

The account signature is stored as HTML (authored in the workbench's hybrid
rich-text / HTML editor). The signature lives IN the draft body: every
draft-write path appends the plain-text rendering to the body via
:func:`append_signature_text`, so a draft synced upstream (Gmail / Outlook)
already shows the signature — it used to be added only at send time, so
upstream drafts looked unsigned. Send remains the safety net: it appends the
signature if a (legacy / hand-made) draft still lacks it, and upgrades an
in-body plain signature to the rendered HTML block with a plain-text fallback,
so mail goes out ``multipart/alternative`` and renders in every client. Kept in
ONE place so every path produces the signature identically.

The AI drafter itself still returns the reply body only — the signature is
appended once, deterministically, by the draft/send paths here, never by the
model (which would double or mangle it).

The signature goes directly under the NEW text, ABOVE any quoted trailing
thread. The composer sends one ``body_text`` containing both (new text + "\\n\\n"
+ quote), so appending to the end of it put the signature underneath the whole
quoted conversation on every signed reply — see :mod:`.quoting` for the split.
