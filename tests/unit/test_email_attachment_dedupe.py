"""Attachment inserts must name a real ON CONFLICT arbiter.

A bare ``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`` on email_attachments was dead code: the only
unique constraint was the primary key on a freshly generated ``id``, so it never
fired and every re-hydration re-inserted the same files. Migration 88 adds
UNIQUE (message_id, provider_attachment_id); these tests pin that all three
insert sites reference it as their arbiter, so the dedupe can never silently
regress to the bare form again.

The ON CONFLICT *behaviour* itself is a Postgres guarantee exercised against the
live database; here we guard the call sites, which is what regressed before.
