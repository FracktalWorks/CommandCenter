"""Projects · dependencies and subtasks, made reachable (WS-27p).

Spec: ``ai-company-brain/specs/project_management_app.md`` §11.2 item 8, §11.14.

    GET /projects/tasks/{task_id}/relations   → subtasks + links, both directions

*"`pm_task_links` and `parent_task_id` both exist, unreachable from the board.
Data with no surface is a promise the product does not keep."*

**Both halves were genuinely unreachable, and for different reasons.** Links
could be created and deleted since WS-27a but never LISTED — `get_task` returns
a `links` *count* and nothing else, so no client could draw one. Subtasks could
be created from the panel but never listed either: `?parent_task_id=` exists on
the list endpoint and nothing called it.

**No migration.** The tables have been right since 146; what was missing was a
way to read them and one rule nobody had written down.

**That rule: `blocks` may not form a cycle.** `assert_no_task_cycle` has guarded
`parent_task_id` since WS-27a, and the same hazard sat unguarded on links — A
blocks B blocks C blocks A is a deadlock no human can resolve by finishing
something, and any "is this blocked" walk over it does not terminate.

**Blocked-ness is DERIVED and SHOWN, never enforced.** A task is blocked when
something that blocks it is still open. Refusing to close a blocked task is the
obvious next step and is deliberately not taken: dependencies in a real
workspace are frequently approximate, and a tool that will not let somebody
finish work they have finished is a tool they route around — after which the
links stop being maintained and the feature is worse than absent.
